Skincare Brand for Modern Rituals</h1>\n        <p class=\"subtitle\">Where beauty is not an act of performance but rather a practice of presence</p>\n\n        <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n            <div class=\"content-preview collapsed\" id=\"contentPreview\">\n                <p>FÉRA FIVE is a luxury skincare brand created for modern rituals, where beauty is not an act of performance but rather a practice of presence. Created for the woman who moves with quiet confidence, FÉRA FIVE offers clean beauty products and daily skincare essentials that support self-possession, balance, and inner alignment.</p>\n\n                <p>In a world over-filled with noise, excess, and visual overload, FÉRA FIVE is different. Our philosophy is one of restraint, intention, and emotional sophistication. Beauty, here, is not about becoming someone else—it is about returning to yourself.</p>\n\n                <h2>A New Era of Luxury Beauty in India</h2>\n                <p>FÉRA FIVE is entering the Indian luxury beauty and personal care category at an optimum and ideal period. The beauty and personal care category is currently witnessing an explosive growth rate of 14% yearly. The product category has thus led Indians to redefine what luxury actually is. It is clear. Indians want luxury no more.</p>\n\n                <p>The distinguishing feature of the brand FÉRA FIVE lies in the fact that it exists in untouched territory, which includes quiet luxury along with self-confidence. There exists zero competition as the brand aims for elegance combined with emotional intelligence, while skincare acts as a form of grounding.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <button class=\"read-more-btn\" id=\"readMoreBtn\" onclick=\"toggleContent()\">Read More</button>\n\n            <div class=\"full-content\" id=\"fullContent\">\n                <h2>From Aspiration to Alignment</h2>\n                <p>Luxury beauty has typically been described as being all about aspiration, transformation, or heritage ritual. FÉRA FIVE embodies an evolution of beauty from being sought to being aligned.</p>\n\n                <p>This is luxury beauty, not as a display, but as a reality. Not as a promise of becoming something else, but as an affirmation of who you already are. All of our products were developed to support you in making this change, deliberately and beautifully.</p>\n\n                <h2>Beauty Rooted in Self-Possession</h2>\n                <p>At the heart of FÉRA FIVE's philosophy are the firm's founding principles: that beauty isn't just for decoration, beauty is for declaration; beauty isn't for those who shout, beauty's for those who whisper and know with certainty.</p>\n\n                <p>FÉRA FIVE is a luxury ritual brand for Indian women who own their own terms of power – beauty as self-alignment, as presence, as opposed to beauty as approval-seeking behavior, as noise. This philosophy guides our formulations, textures, and the way our products are used: daily, diligently, in moderation.</p>\n\n                <h2>Clean Formulations. Refined Experiences.</h2>\n                <p>As FÉRA FIVE, as a luxury skincare brand, FÉRA FIVE prides itself in finding balance between efficacy and elegance. It prides itself in the clean beauty approach to beauty.</p>\n\n                <p>We believe skin care should feel as good as it performs. No wasted steps. No redundant activities. Only what your skin needs. Delivered carefully and precisely.</p>\n\n                <h2>Signature Rituals by FÉRA FIVE</h2>\n                <p>Each product in the FÉRA FIVE collection is intended as a ritual, something to return to, not something we're constantly chasing after. We're talking products that are meant to live on your shelf, not on the fringes.</p>\n\n                <div class=\"product-section\">\n                    <h3>Hydrafusion Moisture</h3>\n                    <p>Hydrafusion Moisture is the best face moisturizer for the lady who craves hydration, hydration depth, without the heaviness.
